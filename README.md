Key features:
• Create baseline
• Export the baseline to a txt file
• Import a baseline from a previous JSON
• Quick access to BW product catalog (won't work outside BW network) How to use:
1. When first opening the program, you'll be greeted by the header tab
Header tab: In this tab the user may enter the 'header' part of the baseline, Instructions and example is already in this tab.
2. Menu -> Select the desired Tab -> Add the device
This function adds a device to the baseline. The device is added to the appropriate tab.
Each device has a unique set of fields that are required in the baseline.
3. Menu -> Catheters & Extenders -> Catalog Helper Search
Is a function that replaces the need to check Biosense catheter catalog. The user may insert and D number to that field, and get the needed fields to document in the baseline.
This function adds Catheters and Extenders to the list under Catheters Tab.

Note - ALl devices are created and removed dynamically. There is no limit to the amount of items added, and when removed the item numbering is updated accordingly.
